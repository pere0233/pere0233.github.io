Brief description on how the web portfolio was created.
- The web portfolio was made with 4 navigation items, which are the homepage, services tab, experience and contact.
- The homepage consists of a welcome note.
- Services tab displays the services I provide for my clients and details about my previous work.
- Experience page contains information about myself and the qualifications to further with.
- Contact tab is for the clients to contact me to ask further about my business and to further about the neccessary requirements.
- Written HTML and CSS validated.

Challenges faced during development.
- Time Management.
- Whether to use bootstrap or CSS format.
- Started on bootstrap but got confused in the process, and started new on the html and cs method.
- Completed on the HTML and took time on CSS designing and attached a slight coding of bootstrap as well.

How I overcame those changes.
- Changed my path to CSS and started working on the project.

What I learnt by creating my web portfolio.
- I need to pre plan and make a detailed and easier how to do note before starting up on project.
